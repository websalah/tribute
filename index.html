            <p><b>Steve Jobs</b> debuted the first <b>Macintosh</b> computer before a packed room of shareholders on <b>January 24th, 1984.</b> 
                But that wasn't the end of the story: only days later, Jobs appeared before <b>the Boston Computer Society</b> to 
                show the Mac to the public for the first time. Time has recovered the full, 90-minute presentation 
                never-before-released online, along with the entire backstory of how the presentation came about. 
                The BCS was an important audience for Jobs to court, since founder <b>Jonathan Rotenberg</b> was a noted
                industry figure at the time. But this was Jobs in his glory. According to <b>Dan Bricklin</b>, co-inventor of <b>VisiCalc</b>, 
                "<i>You get to see Steve when Steve became the Steve Jobs.</i>"
